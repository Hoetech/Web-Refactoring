# Web Refactoring Using Oxygen XML: Refactor the Dataset Using XML and XML Schema

# Module Details:
This module focuses on refactoring the data set of a project using XML and XML Schema. The goal is to ensure consistent naming conventions for entities and attributes and design appropriate XSD schemas for each instance document. Additionally, the aim is to demonstrate the validity of the XML against these schemas using Oxygen XML during the presentation.
Individual Task Title: Refactor the Dataset Using XML and XML-Schema

# Requirements:
## 1. Naming Conventions:
   It is crucial to establish consistent naming conventions for entities and attributes within the dataset. This ensures clarity and coherence throughout the refactoring process. By following standardized naming conventions, the dataset becomes more manageable and easier to work with.

## 2. XSD Schemas:
   Designing appropriate XSD schemas for each instance document is essential. The schemas should accurately define the structure, data types, and relationships within the dataset. Well-designed schemas enable effective validation and facilitate future modifications or additions to the dataset.

## 3. Validation:
   It is imperative to validate the XML against the defined XSD schemas. Oxygen XML, a powerful XML editor, can be utilized to validate the dataset during the presentation. By ensuring the validity of the XML, it confirms that the dataset adheres to the defined structure and constraints, enhancing its reliability and consistency.

# Maximum Marks:
To achieve the maximum marks in this task, it is recommended to thoroughly analyze and explore how XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) can be applied to generate the required functionality of the website. XSLT enables the transformation of XML data into different formats, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the site's functionality and presentation.

# Outcome:
By successfully completing this task, the dataset will be refactored using XML and XML Schema, resulting in a more structured and standardized dataset. The implementation of consistent naming conventions and appropriate XSD schemas ensures improved clarity, maintainability, and extensibility. Additionally, by validating the XML against the schemas using Oxygen XML, the dataset's reliability is confirmed, providing a strong foundation for further development and integration into the website.
